**EducationOn** provides small, auditable tools for common administrative tasks in school environments‚Äîespecially where students share PCs and accounts, and where you need quick wins without a full AD/Intune rollout.

## üìÇ What‚Äôs inside

- **RedirectFolders.bat**  
  Redirects user shell folders (e.g., *Desktop*, *Documents*) to local paths per machine‚Äîuseful for shared accounts and fast lab resets. Runs with elevation and prints a summary at the end.

- **WinUpdateServ.bat** (+ `readme-WinUpdateServ.txt`)  
  Helper script for handling Windows Update service behavior in lab/classroom scenarios. See the companion `readme-WinUpdateServ.txt` for usage and caveats.

- **link to QRCode.xlsx**  
  Spreadsheet template for generating QR codes (e.g., Wi-Fi join links, classroom rules, support contacts).

- **tools/**  
  Staging area for additional scripts/utilities (to be documented as they are added).

## üéØ Why this exists (School context)

- **Shared PCs & rotating users** ‚Äî Keep student data local/per-device to avoid profile bloat and speed up logons.  
- **Minimal infra required** ‚Äî Helpful where there is no domain controller or where GPO/Intune isn‚Äôt feasible across all sites.  
- **Auditable & simple** ‚Äî Plain batch scripts that can be inspected, adapted, or rewritten in PowerShell.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Clone or download**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edge-intel/EducationOn
   ```
   Or download as ZIP from GitHub.

2. **Run as Administrator**  
   - Right-click the script (`RedirectFolders.bat` or `WinUpdateServ.bat`) ‚Üí **Run as administrator**.  
   - Follow on-screen prompts.

3. **Test on a pilot PC first**  
   Validate behavior with a non-critical machine (or VM) before broad rollout.

> üí° Tip: create a local admin-only USB with the scripts + a small change log so techs can execute consistent steps in classrooms.

## üõ† Usage notes

### RedirectFolders.bat
- **What it does**: Lists users on the device, lets you choose targets, then redirects selected folders (Desktop/Documents) to local machine paths. Copies existing content and updates the registry mappings.

- **Log/summary**: The script prints a success/failure summary at the end.  

### WinUpdateServ.bat
- **What it does**: Assists with Windows Update service behavior for lab PCs.  
- **Documentation**: See `readme-WinUpdateServ.txt` for exact switches, modes, and safeguards.
